He joined forces with Lars Alexandersson, and together they prepared to commence Operation Lightning, a plan to eliminate the other bearer of the devil gene, Kazuya Mishima. Jin had once plunged the world into chaos in order to resurrect Azazel, the devil gene's progenitor. His plan was to permanently extinguish the devil gene by defeating Azazel once and for all, even if it cost him his own life. While Jin managed to defeat Azazel, he lost consciousness and fell into a deep sleep. During his absence, G Corporation, led by Kazuya, took over the world by force. Several months later, Jin finally regained consciousness. His deadly struggle with Azazel had taught him how to control his inner devil power. Jin swore to end Kazuya's reign of terror in order to atone for the war and destruction he had caused.",
